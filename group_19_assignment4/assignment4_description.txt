# Assignment 4 2D Animation- Project Description

## Animation Summary

Our animation project for Assignment 4 was focused on creating a dynamic scene with various animated objects, including shurikens, kunais, and spinning swords, set against a colorful backdrop of grass and a changing sky. The animation aimed to showcase the movement and interaction of these objects using Processing.

## Included Classes

### Shuriken

The `Shuriken` class represents a spinning star-shaped object. It moves randomly across the canvas, bouncing off the screen edges. The rotation and scale of the shuriken change dynamically to create a spinning effect. The shuriken can have different colors.

### Kunai

The `Kunai` class represents small throwing knives. Similar to shurikens, kunais move randomly, and their position is updated continuously. The user can customize their colors.

### Sword

The `Sword` class represents spinning swords that move across the screen in random directions. These swords rotate as they move and change scale. The user can specify the sword's color.

### Background

The background class creates a colorful backdrop, simulating a changing sky and grass. It provides a dynamic and visually appealing environment for the animated objects.

## Unexpected Challenges

1. **Synchronization of Movements**: Ensuring that all objects moved and interacted smoothly in the animation required careful synchronization and adjusting the movement parameters.

2. **Randomization**: Implementing random movement and rotation while avoiding sudden jerks or excessive rotations was challenging. 

3. **Color Customization**: Allowing users to customize the color of each object class required additional code for color handling.

## Division of Work

-Ginger: Implemented the `Sword` class and background animations.

-Wilson: Implemented the main file and "Shuriken" class. Made adjustments when needed.

-Michael: Implemented the 'kunai' class and made adjustments to the main .pde file

Each group member was responsible for their assigned class and contributed to resolving unexpected challenges collectively.

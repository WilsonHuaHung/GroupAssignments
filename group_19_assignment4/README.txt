## Processing Sketch - Assignment 4 2D Animation

This project explores the use of object-oriented programming in graphics, as well as scene hierarchies to perform transformations for 2D animation. This animation within Processing will loop indefinitely. This animation is expected to be complex with multiple objects (and therefore multiple classes) and has several levels of scene/shape transformations in order to create a range of interesting, cohesive movements.

## Description

This scene has a grass and sky background. There are three distinct objects a sword, kunai, and shuriken that bounce randomly across the screen with random sizing.

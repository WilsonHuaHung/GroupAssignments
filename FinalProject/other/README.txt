2D Game Project

**Overview
This project is a 2D game developed using the Processing programming environment. The game features a player character, enemies, powerups, and shields, providing an engaging and dynamic gaming experience.

**How to Play
*Controls:
Use the WASD to move the player character.
Press the designated keys (1-4) to select an element for the player character when prompted.
Press mouse left click to shoot projectiles and the chosen element projectile type will be based on the selected element.

**Game Mechanics:
*Leveling Up:
The player can level up by collecting powerups. The leveling thresholds are 200 increments of powerup count i.e level 1 you need 200, level 2 you need 400, and so on.

*Element Selection:
At level 2, the player can choose an element (Fire, Water, Earth, Air) by pressing the corresponding number key during the element selection menu.

*Shield Activation:
At level 3 and upwards, the player gains a shield upon leveling up. The shield can be activated and deactivated during gameplay.

*Collision Handling:
Colliding with enemies without an active shield results in losing a life. The game ends when all lives are depleted.

**Installation:
1. Ensure you have Processing installed (download from processing.org).
2. Open the main sketch file (e.g., finalProject_main in Processing)
3. If you get a sound error. Go to sketch and download the "sound" library. This will remove the error and 4. allow the user to hear the music in the game.

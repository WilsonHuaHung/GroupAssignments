**Overview:
Our final project is a 2D game implemented in Java using the Processing framework. The game involves a player leveling up levels, shooting projectiles, and using shields to defend against enemies.

**Functionalities and Implementations:

**Player Class:
The Player class handles the player's movement, shooting projectiles, leveling up, and collisions with enemies and powerups.

Player animation is implemented using a sprite sheet and the Processing Animation class.
The player can select an elemental power (fire, water, earth, air) at level 2, influencing projectile behavior.

**Projectile Classes:
Multiple projectile classes (FireProjectile, WaterProjectile, EarthProjectile, AirProjectile) handle different elemental projectiles with unique cooldowns.

**Shield Class:
The Shield class provides the player with a protective shield at level 3 and upwards

The shield deactivates upon collisions with enemies, and the player loses no lives during this period.

**Enemy Classes:
FireEnemy and WaterEnemy classes represent different enemy types with distinct behaviors and appearances.
Enemies move across the screen, and collisions with the player result in life deduction.

**Powerup Class:
The Powerup class represents collectible items that, when obtained, contribute to the player's powerup count.

**Challenges Faced:
- Sprite Animation | Integrating sprite animations for the player required understanding the Processing Animation class and synchronizing it with player actions.
- Collision Handling | Ensuring proper collision detection between projectiles, enemies, and shields without unexpected behavior or glitches was a challenging aspect. The additional layer with the shield being activated and deactivated cause great troubleshooting. 

**Individual Contributions:
Each group member took responsibility for specific aspects of the project to ensure active participation and mastery of assigned tasks.

Wilson Hua handled the implementation of the player class, including movement, leveling up, shield functionality, selecting element type, shield interaction, collision with fire and water enemies, powerup interaction, shooting projectiles, fire enemies and water enemies, scoring and lives, and README and description text files.

# Assignment 7 - Element Run Game

## Group Members

- Ginger Hudson
Worked on the loading game screen, lives counter, background and text visuals and the game over screen. 
Enhanced the game's visual display and create a user-friendly GUI

- Michael Crosson
Implemented additional game features (e.g., power-ups or special abilities).

- Wilson Hua
Implemented Water and Wind enemies and collision mechanics
## Project Description

### Game Functionality
The game loads with a starting screen that by pressing any button the game will load. Once loaded, your player starts and you have three lives to play before the game is over.

### Rules of Play
Players control the character by using the
Movement: 
W or w: Move up 
A or a: Move left 
S or s: Move down 
D or d: Move right

If you collide with a water enemy your player will increase in size. If you collide with an green triangle powerup your player will decrease in size but regain more powerups. If you collide with a fire enemy you will lose one live. You can collect power-ups by surviving as long as possible and interacting with the powerups with points earned for avoiding enemies.

### Win and Lose Conditions

Players win by surviving as long as possible and accumulating the highest score. Losing occurs when the player runs out of lives from colliding with fire enemies.

## Classes
Enemy: updates and displays the enemies
FireEnemy: creates the red randomized circles on screen 
WaterEnemy: creates the blue randomized circles on screen.
Powerup: create the green triangle to collid with for powerup points

Player: creates the player for game play 
### Unexpected Challenges

There was challenges encounted in fine-tuning the collision detection and ensuring smooth enemy generation. Debugging and refining the movement of enemies were crucial to enhancing the overall gaming experience.
In addition, the lives counter that worked in hadn with collision detection to determine when the game ended.

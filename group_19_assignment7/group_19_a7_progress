# Group Progress Report
## Assignment 7 - Game Development

**Team Members:**
- Wilson Hua
- [Team Member 2]
- [Team Member 3]

### Idea
- Our game concept involves a simple 2D game where players control a character to avoid falling enemy objects. The player's goal is to survive as long as possible while collecting points by avoiding collisions with enemy objects.
- We aim to create an engaging experience with dynamic enemy movement, responsive player controls, and a scoring system that motivates players to keep improving.

### Plan
- We have established the foundation of our game, including player and enemy objects, basic player controls, and collision detection.
- Our plan is to further develop the game by adding more enemy types, improving visual elements, and refining the scoring system. Each team member has specific responsibilities, as outlined below:
    - Wilson Hua: Implement Water and Wind enemies.
    - [Team Member 2]: Implement additional game features (e.g., power-ups or special abilities).
    - [Team Member 3]: Enhance the game's visual display and create a user-friendly GUI.
- We will collaborate and integrate our individual components to create a cohesive game.

### Simulation Techniques
- We've customized appearance and behavior for our game elements as follows:
    - Player Character: The player controls a blue circle that moves left and right. The character avoids enemy objects that fall from the top of the screen.
    - Enemy Objects: The enemy objects vary in appearance and behavior. Water enemies flow downward, mimicking gravity, while Wind enemies exhibit fast and erratic movement. The code structure allows for easy addition of more enemy types.
    
### Interactive Functionality
- Interactive features and controls for players include:
    - Keyboard Controls: Players can move the player character left (with 'A') and right (with 'D').
    - Mouse Interaction: The game allows players to restart the game by clicking the mouse button when the game is over.
    - Scoring System: Points are earned by avoiding enemy objects, providing a clear objective for players.

### Progress Update
- The code foundation for our game is in place. We have implemented the basic player and enemy behavior, collision detection, and scoring.
- Challenges encountered include refining enemy behaviors and fine-tuning the game's visual elements.
- We are making steady progress and aim to complete all functionalities by the project deadline.

### Responsibilities
- Each team member is responsible for specific aspects of the project:
    - Wilson Hua: Implementing Water and Wind enemies and their behaviors.
    - [Team Member 2]: Developing additional game features to enhance gameplay.
    - [Team Member 3]: Improving the game's visual display and creating a user-friendly GUI.
- We are coordinating efforts to ensure a smooth integration of our components.

### Integration Plan
- We will integrate our individual components into a cohesive game by ensuring that all code is well-documented and follows a consistent coding style.
- Regular code reviews and testing will help us identify and resolve any integration issues.

### Conclusion
- Our game development project is on track to meet the assignment's requirements.
- We look forward to further enhancing our game with additional features and improving the overall user experience.

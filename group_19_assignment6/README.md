# Particle Simulation - Fire, Water, and Wind

## Introduction
This Particle Simulation project simulates the behavior of three types of particles: Fire, Water, and Wind. Each particle type has unique characteristics and can be interactively controlled. This README provides instructions on how to run and interact with the simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- You need to have Processing installed on your computer to run this simulation.

### Installation
1. Download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the main Processing sketch file `Main.pde` using the Processing Development Environment (PDE).

## Running the Simulation
1. Run the sketch by clicking the "Run" button in the Processing PDE.
2. A window will open displaying the simulation scene.

## Interactivity
The simulation is interactive, allowing you to control and interact with the particles.

### Particle Types
- Press "1" to switch to Fire particles.
- Press "2" to switch to Water particles.
- Press "3" to switch to Wind particles.

### Adding Particles
- Click the mouse within the simulation window to add a burst of particles of the currently selected type. 

## Optional Features
You can consider implementing additional interactive features for extra credit:

- Adjusting particle parameters using sliders or other controls.
- Any other interactive elements you would like to add.

## Project Structure
- `Main.pde`: The main Processing sketch file.
- `Particle.pde`: Base class for particles.
- `Fire.pde`: Class for Fire particles.
- `Water.pde`: Class for Water particles.
- `Wind.pde`: Class for Wind particles.
- `ParticleSystem.pde`: Class to manage different particle types.

## Known Issues
- [List any known issues or limitations of the simulation, if any.]

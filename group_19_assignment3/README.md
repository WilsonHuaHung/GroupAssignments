### Once opening the parent folder 'group_19_assignment3', open and run the 'extract_words.py' file and that will overwrite the 'allwords.txt', 'uniquewords.txt', and 'wordfrequency.txt' files in their respective locations. 
### Then you can run the 'a3_novelvisualization.pde' file in the 'a3_novelvisualization' folder to get an example of the word cloud. 
### You can also run the 'a3_wordfrequency.pde' file in the 'a3_wordfrequency' folder to get the graphical representation of word frequency.
